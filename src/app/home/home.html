      Welcome to Brayden Jonsson's website! I am a current Computer Science and
      Physics student at the University of Utah, class of '26, and I am also an
      incoming SE1 at Lucid Software. I am very passionate about working in
      software and have many hobbies/interests that I want to try and share on
      this site.

      I have been developing software since at least 2018 when I took a required
      software development course in 9th grade. I immediately recognized that I
      had a talent and interest in coding, and went on to take as many
      development courses as I could in high school. And of course, I went on to
      start university as a computer science student. I've always been trying to
      learn cool, new technology, so I consider myself to have experience in
      most of the "common" languages. I don't think there's a single language
      that fits every scenario, but my favorite language right now is Rust.

      For the most part, I'm studying physics for fun. I don't have any
      significant theory or career plan that incorporates these skills. Instead,
      I've just always had interest in these topics and while I've been focused
      on building a career in CS, taking physics is a good opportunity to
      practice my math and science skills, learn amazing things about how the
      universe works, and (playfully) act elitist towards my math major friends.
