      Welcome to Brayden Jonsson's website! I am a current Computer Science and
      Physics student at the University of Utah, class of '26, and I am also an
      incoming SE1 at Lucid Software. I am very passionate about working in
      software and have many hobbies/interests that I want to try and share on
      this site.
